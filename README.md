## 👋 About Me

I'm an aspiring **SOC Analyst** with a growing passion for cybersecurity, digital forensics, and defending systems from real-world threats. I believe cybersecurity isn't just a career—it's a responsibility. Every log, alert, and vulnerability represents a person, a business, or a digital space worth protecting.

### What I'm Currently Working On
- Building my skills in **Blue Team operations**
- Learning tools like **Wireshark, Splunk, SIEM platforms, and Virtual Labs**
